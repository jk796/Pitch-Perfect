# Pitch-Perfect
## Udacity.com ios Nanodegree project 1
Swift Language Version: Swift 5<br/>
Xcode Version: 11.3.1

## Application Description
This app records a sound and plays it back with different types of effects(snail, rabbit, chipmunk, Darth Vader, echo, and reverb) based on user's input.

## From this project, I have leanred to:
Create a new project from existing iOS app templates<br/>
Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard<br/>
Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView<br/>
Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code<br/>
Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController<br/>
Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class<br/>
Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device<br/>
Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code<br/>
